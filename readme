# Java Chat Server and Client

This repository contains a simple chat server and client implemented in Java. The server can handle multiple clients concurrently, and messages sent by a client are broadcasted to all other clients.

## ChatServer

The ChatServer class starts a server on port 12345 and waits for clients to connect. When a client connects, a new thread is started to handle the client's messages. The server maintains a map of all connected clients and their output streams.

## ChatClient

The `ChatClient` class connects to the server and starts a new thread for receiving messages. It also provides a method for sending messages to the server.

## Usage

1. Start the server:

  bash
java ChatServer


The server will start and wait for clients to connect.

2. Start the client:

  bash
java ChatClient


The client will connect to the server and start receiving messages. You can type messages into the console to send them.

## Example

Here is an example of the server and two clients interacting:
